         Over the next few weeks, I will continually update this page to show off my progress on my Digital Fabrication final project!
        </p>

        <h4>Initial Ideas</h4>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Here are a couple of ideas I had initally for my final project! I was unsure about how complex our projects should be, so I created three different scale ideas. 
        </p>
        
        <div class="w3-third w3-padding">
            <h3>Chess Set!</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                My first - and most involved - idea is a chess board. The components would include 3D printed pieces, a laser cut checkerboard, a 3D printed frame and a laser cut box drawer beneath the board.
               </p>
               <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/chessSketch.png">
        </div>
        <div class="w3-third w3-padding">
            <h3>Jewelry Tree!</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                My second - and slightly less involved - idea is a Jewelry tree and custom base. The components would include a laser cut 3D tree with holes and hooks, and a 3D printed base with slots for other jewelry and an "x" slot to hold the tree.
               </p>
               <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/jewelrySketch.png">
        </div>
        <div class="w3-third w3-padding">
            <h3>"Desk" Drawers!</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                My third - and simplest - idea is a desk top organizer with working drawers. The components would include a two pieces of a 3D frame that would be secured together, laser cut boxes for the drawers, and 3D printed knobs.
               </p>
               <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/drawerSketch.png">
        </div>
            
        <h4>Consultation Reflection</h4>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Initially, I drafted a couple of ideas that I then propsed to Whitney during my consultation. With her help, I decided to pursue my first idea.
            I plan to create a custom chess board, with a laser cut board, an attached  3D printed piece holder, and 3D printed chess pieces. 
            <br> 
            I did have to reconsider the design of my framing element, as I planned on initially 3D printing this component. Prusas are not very good at flat elements, and my initial full frame around the entire checkboard may be to big for 
            the printers in the Fab Lab. So - instead I will be creating a box element with a checkboard on top using the Glowforge, and creating 3D printed piece holders that are secured to the board. My current plan for securing 
            the piece holders to the board, will be to add two holes in the side pieces, then add a two threaded screws to the side of the holder, which will fit in those holes and will be fastened with 3D printed nuts. I have found a couple of <a href = "https://all3dp.com/2/3d-printing-threads-and-screws-all-you-need-to-know/">online tutorials</a> for 
            creating threading in Fusion 360 I plan to follow. 
            <br>
            Currently, this is my plan for my iterations:
            <ol style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Wooden board - initial interation will be with wood, but final will be with opaque acrylic.</li>
                <li>Chess Pieces - submit CAD and begin printing one set of custom designed pieces</li>
                <li>Piece Holder - 3D print screw and nut to make sure it works</li>
                <li>Final Board - re-cut board on different, final material</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h4>Week 1 Status</h4>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Over the last few days, I have been painstakingly printing and re-printing my prototype for a screw and nut in order to attach the 
          piece holder to the board itself. I used Fusion 360's thread tool to create the internal and external threads. After four tries, I have finally was able to get a good fitting screw onto my prototyped piece holder. 
          </p><br>
          <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/threadCad.png">
          <p style="text-align: left;">
          <br>
          I have also been prototyping my pieces. After a couple of iterations, I decided to have a base of 20mm. While still a little small, I cannot have them exceed this size as the piece holder would
          then end up being too large for the printer plate. I designed my pieces in TinkerCad as opposed to Fusion360, 
          since they are not super complicated, and with six different pieces to design, I opted for the simpler more user-friendly interface. I have also decided to have a astrology theme for my board to make it more exciting!
          Here are some of the current designs I have for my pieces. 
</p>
          <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/piecesCAD.png">
          <p style="text-align: left;"></p>
          <br> I printed a portion of the piece holder to make sure it could fit my pieces and that the screw would work properly. After playing around with the piece sizes, I make some tweaks to the piece holder and below are the final dimensions of the design. 
        </p>
        <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/holderCad.png">
        <p style="text-align: left;"></p>
        <br> Here are some photos of my fabricated prototypes!</p>
      <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/proto1.png">
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <br> My next steps are to finish up the piece holder design - I plan to add some designs on the bottom of the slots to specify where each piece goes - then print it, as well as begin printing more pieces. Additionally, I plan to 
      laser cut my board design and assemble to make sure the components fit together before cutting into acyrlic.</p>


      <h4>Week 2 Status</h4>
        <p style="text-align: left;"> I have spent many hours over the last week proto-typing my chess board and pieces. I have finished designing all pieces and have made final
        decisions on the sizes. I laser cut my board into wood to test out the design and ensure that the holes of the board lined up with the screws on the piece holder.
      The Glowforge was going to take over an hour to engrave the checkerboard, so for the proto-type I opted out of this - and will discuss with Madison if I should plan to paint the acrylic version, as 
    it will take much longer with that material. Everything fit together wonderfully! I am still having some trouble with my nuts and screws, but the piece holder fits the pieces perfectly and will attach nicely 
  once I get the right nut size. I plan on re-printing the piece holder with a higher quality for the final product. <br>Below is my SVG file for my board that I created using Boxes.py and Adobe Illustrator, as well as some images of the assembled board.  </p>

          <img style="width:75%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/boardAI.png"><br>
          <img style="width:75%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/sides.jpg"><br>
          <img style="width:75%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/full.jpg"><br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
          Since I had some issues with the screws, I have a full sized piece holder that shows how nicely the pieces fit into the slots, and a smaller version to show 
          how the holders will be attached to the board.<br>
          </p>
          <img style="width:75%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/fit.jpg"><br>
          <img style="width:75%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/attach.jpeg"><br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            I completed all of the designs for my pieces, and changed the design of the rook.<br>
            </p>
            <img style="width:60%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/rook.png"><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              I also slightly changed the design of my piece holder, by filleting the edges<br>
              </p>
              <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/fillet.png"><br>
              <p style="text-align: left;">
                Next week, I will print out the rest of the pieces using silver and sparkly blue PLA as well as laser cut the board into purple opaque acrylic!<br>
                </p>

<hr>
    <h4>Final!</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">After recieving my order of PLA and acrylic, I was ready to start fabricating my final chess board!</p>
      <h5>Glowforge : the Board</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">I cut the acrylic board using the Glowforge laser cutter. THe only tweaks I made from my previous design were increasing the width of the material
      to 3.45mm and increasing the heigh of the sides a bit to make the board taller. The engraving of the checkerboard took an hour of painstaking waiting, but the result was worth it!</p>
      <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/acyrlic_glow.png"><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The assembly of the board was particularly tricky. It took a lot of trial and error (and smacking on the table) to get the teeth of each side
      to fit into each other. But, with Bella's help, we final got the board together!</p>
      <img style="width:60%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/bella.png"><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Since the acrylic board was completely opaque, the engravings were not as visible as I had hoped. To solve this, I painted the letters, numbers and zodiac signs 
        with white paint to make them pop!</p>
        <img style="width:75%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/bella.png"><br>
     
        

        <h5>Prusa : the Pieces</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">I stuck with the designs of most of my pieces, except for the rook and (after losing my original design) the knight. </p>
      <img style="width:40%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/rookKnight.png"><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">It took me two and a half weeks to print all 32 pieces. Only the knight and the king required supports, and other than the intial design of the pawn, 
      the printing went very smoothly! I did find that the blue sparkly PLA was far more stringy than the silver, which made removing the supports and cleaning up the excess strands trickier.  </p>
      <img style="width:60%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/pieceFab.png"><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">They fit wonderfully into the piece holder, and look great!</p>
      <img style="width:60%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/pieceDone.png"><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Here are the five iterations of the pawn, and a look at all the pieces!</p>
      <img style="width:80%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/pawnIt.png"><br>
      <img style="width:60%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/allpieces.png"><br>
      <h5>Assembly!</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">After lots of trial and error, with my threaded peices, I was finally able to get the piece holders properly attached to the board and could put everything together! Below are some images
      of my holder and (many) screw iterations and prototypes!</p>
      <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/holderit.png"><br>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The screws fit perfectly into the holes and securing them was super easy!</p>
      <img style="width:60%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/connect.png"><br>
   
      <h5>Final!</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">After a month of planning, prototyping and fabricating, my chess board was finally complete!</p>
      <img style="width:90%;padding-top:16px;padding-bottom: 16px;"src = "https://hannahklord.github.io/finalSS/holderit.png"><br>

     <h3>Thoughts & Learning Curves</h3>
     <p style="text-align: left;">This course is by far one of my favorites I've taken here at Wheaton. I learned so much and was so amazed and proud of the things
    I was able to create! I was so glad to be able to spend the last few weeks putting all that I learned into practice. This chess board came out so much better than I had originally intended, and I cannot wait to put it to use!<br>I want to thank the whole Fab Lab team for being so kind and helpful!</p>
